chin, wanted to give me palpable demonstration
of the truth. It was with difficulty that I ex-
tricated myself from the hands of the unlucky
shaver, choosing rather to believe than groan.

The Abipones bear the pain inflicted by the
old woman With the forceps, without complain-
ing, that their faces may be smooth and clear;
for they cannot endure them to be rough and
hairy. For this reason, neither sex will suffer Χ
the hairS, with which our eyes are naturally
fortified, but have their eye-brows and eye-
lashes continually plucked up. This naked-
ness of the eyes, though it disfigures the hand-
somest face in a high degree, they deem in-
dispensable to beauty. They ridicule and
despise the Europeans for the thick brows
which overshadow their eyes, and call them
brothers to the ostricheS‚ who have very thick ’
eye-brows. They imagine that the sight of
the eye is deadened, and shaded by the ad-
jacent hairs. Whenever they go out to seek
honey, and return empty-handed, their constant
excuse is, that their eye-brows and eye-laslies
have grown, and prevented them from seeing
the bees which conduct them to the hives.
