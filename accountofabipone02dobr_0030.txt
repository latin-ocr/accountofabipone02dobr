18 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

been derived from the Peruvian IndianS, who
used to cut their children's first hair, at two
years of. age, with a sharp stone for want of a
knife. The ceremony was performed by the
relations, one after another, according to the
degrees of consanguinity3 and at the same time
a name was given to the infant.

It is also a custom, amongst the AbiponeS, to
shave the heads of widows, not without much
lamentation on the part of the women, and
drinking on that of the menÍ¾ and to cover them
with a grey and black hood, made of the threads
of the caraquata, which it is reckoned a crime
for her to take off till she marries again. A
widower has his hair cropped with many cere-
monieS, and his head covered with a little net-
shaped hat, which is not taken off till the hair
grows again. All the men cut off their hair to
mourn for the death of a Cacique. Amongst
the Christian GuaranieS, it is thought a most
shameful and ignominious punishment, when
any disreputable woman has her hair cut off.
I have described the person which liberal na-
ture has bestowed upon the Abipones3 it now
remains for me to show by what means they
disfigure it.
