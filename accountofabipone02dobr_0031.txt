OF THE ANCIENT AND UNIVERSAL METHODS OF DIS-
FIGURING THE PERSON.

MANY Europeans spoil their beauty by eager-
ly imitating foreign customS, and always seek-
ing new methods of adorning their persons,

some of which are common to both sexeS‚
others peculiar to the women. They prick their
skin with a sharp thorn, and scatter fresh ashes

pressed on their foreheadS, aud two small lines
at the corner of each eye extending towards the
ears, besides four transverse lines at the root
of the nose between the eye-brOWS, as national

thorns, not only in the skin, but in the live flesh,
and ashes sprinkled on them whilst streaming
with. blood render them of an indelible blaok.

tend I cannot tell, and the Abipones themselves
