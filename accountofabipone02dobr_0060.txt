48 HisToRY OF THE ABIPONES

one of them kills a tiger, he cuts it into small
portions, and divides it amongst himself and his
companions, that all the hordesmen may share in
what they think so delightful a delicacy. It is
an old complaint amongst physicians that new
seasonings of food imported from the new world
have brought with them new diseases into Eu-
rope. This complaint cannot affect the Abi-
pones, who are unacquainted with seasonings,
and feed upon simple fare. They detest vinegar3
and salt, though as fond of it as goats, they are
seldom able to obtain, their land producing
neither salt nor salt-pits. To remedy this defi-
ciency they burn 3 shrub called by the Spa-,
niards vidriera, and sprinkle its ashes, which have
a saltish taste, on meat and on tobacco leaves,
previously chewed and kneaded together with
the saliva of old women. But 33 many of the
Abiponian hordes are destitute of this shrub, the
ashes of which are used for salt, they generally
eat their meat unsalted. No one ever denied
that the moderate use of salt is wholesome, for
it sucks up noxious humours, and prevents
putrefaction: but the too frequent use of it
deadens the eye-sight, exhausts the better juices,
and creates acrid ones injurious both to the
blood and skin‚ by which means physicians say
that the urinal passages are frequently hurt.
