HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 49

plenty of nitre, or some saltish substance was
mixed with the grass3 if that be wanting the
cattle very soon become ragged and lean.
Meat sprinkled With salt will keep a long time,
but the more pleutifully it is salted the sooner
it stinks and putrefies, the moisture into which
salt dissolves united with heat accelerating
putrefaction. Beef hardened by the air alone,
and fish driedwith nothing but smoke, will keep
many months without a grain of salt, as I and
all the savages know from experience. When
we sailed back from Paraguay to Europe our
chief provisions consisted of meat part salted‚
part dried by the air alone. The latter from
having no salt in it remained well tasted and
free from decay till we reached the port of Cadiz,
while the other soon putrefied and was thrown
into the sea even by the hungry sailors. Now
hear what inference I draw from all this.
Since the Abipones, though they use salt but
seldom and in small quantitieS, are generally
healthy and long-lived, I cannot but suspect
that abstinence from salt conduces more to the
well being of the body than the too unsparing
use of it.

the source of a late old age, firm health‚ and
long life is unanimously agreed by all the great
