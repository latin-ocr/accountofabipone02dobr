is asserted that “ washing in cold water con-
tributes to lengthen life, and that the use of
warni baths has a contrary effect.'’ P. 131.
The same author is of opinion that “ persons who
pass great part of their lives out of doors are
generally longer-lived than those that ‘stay
more within.” The Abipones spend most of
their time out of the house, and consequently
breathe the pure air of heaven which is so
salutary to the human body. Though they
dwell under mats spread like a tent, or in fixed
huts, they never suffer the air to be entirely
excluded. Nor are they content with living in
the open air, they also choose to be buried there,
entertaining an incredible repugnance to sepul-
chres within the church. As the Abipones live -
long and enjoy excellent health, though entire-
ly destitute of physicians and druggistS, Ι can
hardly help reckoning their absence amongst
the causes which co-operate to render the
savages superior in vigour and longevity to
most EuropeanS, amongst whom as physicians
are numerous, and medicine in general use,
there are many sick persons and sew very old
men. The Abiponian physicians, of whom Ι
shall speak more fully hereafter, are impostors
more ignorant than brutes, and totally unwor-
thy the splendid title of physicians‚ being born
not to heal the sick, but to cheat them with
juggleries and fraudS.
