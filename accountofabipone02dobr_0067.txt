H1sT0RY OF THE ABIPONES. 55

That health of body depends in a high
degree upon tranquillity of mind is incontes-
tible: the functions of the brain are disturbed,
the stomach grows languid, the strength fails
for want of food‚ and the better juices are
destroyed, when the mind is oppressed by
turbulent affections, by anxiety, love, sear,
anger, or sadness. The body will be sane if
inhabited by a sane mind. This being the
case, we cannot wonder that the Abipones
are possessed of great vigour and longevity.
Their minds are generally in a tranquil state.
They live reckless of the past, little curious
about the present, and very seldom anxious
for tlie future. They sear danger, but either
'from not perceiving or from despising the
weightiness of it, always think themselves able
to subdue or avoid it. When a numerous foe
is announced to be at hand they either provide
for their safety by a timely ssight, or await
the assault, and amidst jocund songs quaff
‘mead‚ their elixir‚ which inspires them with
courage‚ and banishes sear. Gnawing cares
about the augmentation of their property, or
concerning food and raiment, have no place
amongst them. They make no mortal of such
account as to die, or run mad, for hate or
love of him. No affections with them are either

violent or of long duration. This tranquillity
