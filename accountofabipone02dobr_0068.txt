56 HISTORY or THE ABIPONES.

of mind cherishes the body, and prolongs their
lives to extreme old age. I allow that the
climate in which they live, and which is neither
starved with cold nor parched with heat, is
one strengthener of the health‚ butI deny that
it is the only one3 for neither the Spaniards
nor the other IndianS, though they enjoy the
same temperature of air, live and thrive like
the AbiponeS. Europeans, if they envy the
longevity of the Abipones‚ should imitate, as
far as possible, their manner of life. They
should tranquillize their minds by subduing
vehement passions. They should interpose a
little exereise of body between inaction‚ and
sedentary occupations3 they should mingle
water with wine, rest with labour. They
should moderate their luxuries in dress and
eating. They should use simple food, not
such as is adulterated by art, and for the pur-
pose of satisfying, not of provoking the appetite,
but make sparing application to medicines and
physieians. And lastly, which is of the great—
est importance for preserving vigour, they
should abhor pleasureS‚ the sure destruction of
the body, as much as they desire a green old
age.
