intervals, rattling a gourd full os hardish fruit-
seeds to musical time, and, whirling round to
the right with one foot, and to the left with
another, without ever removing from one spot,
or in the least varying her motions. This fool-
ish crazy dance is interrupted every now and
then by the horrid clangor of military trumpets,
in which the spectators join, making a loud
noise by striking their lips with their hands.
Yet in the midst of all this you ean never per-
ceive the smallest deviation from strict deco-
rum. The men are decently separated from
the women3 the boys from the girls. The'
female dancer, the priestess of these ridicu-
lous ceremonies, as a mark of particular fa-
vour, rubs the thighs of some of the men with
her gourds, and, in the name of their grandfa-
ther, promises them swiftness in pursuing ene-
mies and wild beasts. At the same time the
new male and female jugglers, who are thought
equal to the office, are initiated with many ce-
remonies. Of this most mischievous descrip-
tion of men I am now going to treat more fully.
