HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 71

night-fall an Abiponian boy brought an iron
bridle, an axe, and some other trifles‚ the trea-
sures of his family, to be guarded in my house.
On being asked the reason of his doing so, he
replied that the enemies would arrive in the
night3 for so it had been predicted by his mo-
ther, a famous juggler, who declared that when-
ever the enemy was approaching‚ she felt a
pricking sensation in her left arm. “ Oh!''
replied I, “ you may attribute that to the fleaS‚
my good lad. I can tell you this on my own
, experience. Day and night I feel my left and
my right arm too, as well as other parts of my
body, insolently pricked and stung by fleaS.
If that were an indication of the enemy, we
should never be free from their attacks night
or day.” But my words were vain; for, the ’
report of the old woman's presage got abroad,
and disturbed the whole town all night. Yet,
as often happened, no sign or vestige of the
enemy appeared.

The Abipones, whom the desire of booty or
glory induces to be constantly scheming war
against others, are, in consequence, never free
from suspicions of machinations against them-
selves. The more ardently they desire to take
measures for their safety‚ the more readily
do they believe themselves in danger from
otherS, and generally for some foolish reason.
