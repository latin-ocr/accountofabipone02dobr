belie your profession of Christianity‚ by daring
to corrupt the morals of your fellow-hordes-
men with nefarious arte, and indecent conduct?
After living near twenty years in the school
of Christ, are you not afraid to practise savage
rites the most repugnant to Christian laws?
Your manner of life is exactly suitable to the
name of tiger‚ (he was called Yaguarete, which
means a tiger3) for by your deceits and in-
decencies you tear the poor little sheep of
Christ. Extreme age has conducted you to the
goa] of life 3wunless you repent, what a
wretched death, and when dead what a sad
fate awaits you! I am equally ashamed and
grieved on your account. He whom you be-
hold dead on the cross for you,’' said I, showing
him a crucifix, “will drive you headlong into
hell, to punish your perfidy. Be what you
appear, or appear what you are. Regulate your
conduct according to divine law. But if
savage superstitious are too firmly rooted in
your breast to be ever eradicated, return in-
stantly to the woods of the savageS, to the dens
of wild beasts where you first saw the light,
that your example may not pervert the rest of
your hordesmen, who have dedicated their
lives to religion and virtue. Go, and repent of
your former sin& and by penitence and inno-
cence of life, cleanse away the stains of them.
