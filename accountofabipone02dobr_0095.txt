HISTORY OF THE AmPONJ-JS. 83

If you do not instantly obey my friendly admo-
nitionS, it will be worse for γοα. Henceforward,
you shall not go unpunished. Know, that as
soon as ever I hear of any act of superstition or in-
decencycommitted or attempted by you, at my or-
ders you shall be led about the streets amidst the
hisses of the people, and pelted with cow-dung‚
by a crowd of boys Such is my firm determi-
nation. This is the thyme and frankincense
that shall be offered up to the stinking divinity,
which you have madly dared to arrogate to
yourself and suffered to be adored.” This com-
mination left the old fellow alarmed, and, if I
mistake not, corrected, all good men highly ap-
proving the severity of my speech. No sus-
picions were ever after entertained of him,
though Ι inspected all things with a vigilant
eye and an attentive ear.

As the jugglers perform the offices not only of
soothsayers and physicianS‚ but also of priests
of the ceremonies of superstition, it exceeds
belief what absurd opinions they inculcate into
the ignorant minds of the Abipones. Out of
many, I will mention a few. The Abipones
think that none of their nation would ever die,
were the Spaniards and the jugglers banishcd
from America; for they attribute every one's
death, from whatever cause it may proceed,
