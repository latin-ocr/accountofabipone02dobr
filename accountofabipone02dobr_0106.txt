94 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

With great marks of reverence. On the other
hand, they held the devil, whom they called Cu-
pay, in much contempt. Why did not the Pe-
ruvians impart that reverence for God, and
contempt for the evil spirit to the Abipones, at
the same time that they instructed' them in a
religious observance of the Pleiades? Because
vice is more easily learnt than virtue, as healthy
persons are sooner infected by the sick,
than sick ones cured by the healthy. Yet, if
you persist in denying that the knowledge of
the Pleiades was brought from Peru, I will
oppose you no longer3 but what hinders us from
believing that it crept into Paraguay from the
neighbouring Erazil, where the Tapuyas, for-
merly a fierce and numerous nation‚ greatly
venerated the rise of the Pleiades, and wor—

shipped those stars as divinities with singing
and dancing. As no memorials are at hand

from which any thing determinate can be eli-
cited on this subject, I have thought fit to ad-
duce all these conjectures, opinions, and proba-

bilities which may seem in any way to relate to
the evil spirit, the infamous grandfather of the

AbiponeS, and to the Pleiades the representa-
tion of him.
