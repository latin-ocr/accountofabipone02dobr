obey the corregidor, and other magistrates
of the town. In every Guarany town, there
are a number of caciques‚ who, if men of abi-
litieS, are often promoted to the office of magis-
trateS, that the Indians may not suspect the
Europeans of despising their nobility. There
were five caciques in the town of St. Joachim,
over which I presided. Their names were
Don Ignatius Paranderi, Don Miguel Yeyh,
Don Marco Quirakera, Don J oseph Xavier, and
Don Miguel Yazuka; which last performed
the office of corregidor for many years. Though
a native of the woodS, he was both exceedingly
attached to Christian discipline, and intrepid
in guarding it3 indeed he was above all praise;
which is certainly very uncommon and won-
derful, aS, to say the truth, we have often
found the caciques more stupid than the com-
mon people, and less skilful in the public em-
ployments of the town. who, therefore, can
blame the Abipones, if, setting aside the privi-
lege of birth, they elect a cacique, who, though

of obscure origin, is distinguished for military
valour?
