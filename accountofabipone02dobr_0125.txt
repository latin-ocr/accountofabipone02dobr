the equipment of the horse, and the method of
riding. The bit which they use is composed of
a cow's horn fastened on each side to four little

stuffed with reeds. Stirrups are not in general
use. The men leap on to their horse on the
right side. With the right hand they grasp
the bridle, with the lest a very long spear,
