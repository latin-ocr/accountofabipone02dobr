114 His'ronv OF THE ABIPONES.

saddles used by the women are the same as
those of the men, except that the former, more
studious of external elegance, have theirs
made of the skin of a white cow. When
an Abiponian woman wants to mount her horse,
she throws herself up to the middle upon its
neck, like men in Europe, and then separating
her feet on both sideS, places herself in the
saddle, which has no cushion3 nor does the
hardness of it offend her in journeys of many
days; from which you may perceive that the
skin of the Abipones is harder than leather,
being rendered callous by their constantly
riding without a cushion. Indians who ride
much and long without saddles, frequently hurt
and wound the horse’s back, without receiving
any injury themselves. Ι will now describe
their manner of travelling when they remove
from one place to another. The wife, besides
her husband's bow and quiver, carries all the
domestic furniture, all the pots, gourds, jugs,
shells, balls of woollen and linen thread, wea-
ving instruments, &c. These things are con-
tained in boar-skin bagS, suspended here and
there from the saddle3 where she also places
the whelps, and her young infant if she have
one. Besides these things, she suspends from
the sides of the saddle a large mat, with two
poles, to fix a tent wherever they like, and a
bull's hide to serve for a boat in crossing rivers.
