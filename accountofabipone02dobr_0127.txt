HIsTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 115

No woman will set out on a journey without
a stake like a palm branch, broad at each side
and slender in the middle, made of very hard
wood, and about two ells long, which serves
admirably for digging eatable roots‚ knocking
down fruits from trees, and dry boughs for
lighting a fire, and even for breaking the heads
and arms of enemieS‚ if they meet any by the
way. With this luggage, which you would
think a camel could hardly carry, are the
women's horses loaded in every journey. But
this is not all. You often see two or three wo-
men or girls seated on one horse: not from any
scarcity osbeasts, all having plenty, but because
they are sworn enemies to solitude and silence.
As few horses will bear more than one rider,
unless accustomed to it, they immediately throw
the female trio, but generally without doing
them any injury, except that these Amazons‚
when seen sprawling like snails upon the ground,
excite the mirth of the spectatorS‚ and amidst
mutual laughter, try to scramble again on to
the rustic steed‚ as often as they are thrown off.

The company of women is attended by a
vast number of dogs. As soon as they are
mounted, they all look round, and if one be
missing out of the many which they keep,
begin to eall him with their usual ηὲ n&

ηὲ, repeated as loud as possible a hundred
