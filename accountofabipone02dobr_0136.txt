which <is inclosed behind and on both sideS, by
men on horseback, to keep thern from running
away ε to prevent which, some erect two
hedges, wider at the beginning, and narrower
at the shore itself, through which the beasts are
driven, so that more than two or three cannot

enter the river at a time. The tame oxen and ¹
horses are sent first into the water, and the
wild ones follow without delay. Great care
must be taken, that they be not deprived of the
power of swimming‚ by being too much
crowded. Behind and on both sides the beasts
are watched by Indians, either swimming, or
conveyed in a little bark, that they may make
straight for the opposite shore: for when left
alone, they suffer themselves to be carried
down by the stream, and float to those places
which forbid all access, on account of the high
banks, marshes, or trees, by which they are
impeded. If an ox or a horse be whirled round
in swimming, it will be sucked up by the water,
unable to exert itself any longer. To prevent
this, the Abipones, even in the midst of the
river, mount those oxen, that are either sluggish
or resractory, and taking hold of their horns
with both hands, sit upon their backS‚ striking
their sides with both feet, till, in spite of them-
selveS, they are guided to the opposite shore.
