less dexterous in crossing rivers, than COWS,
which, on account of the greater timidity of
their nature, are more obedient to the driver,

the heads of the animals are suspended on
each side the boat, their bodies scarcely find

sent twenty oxen at a time from the estate, to
the colony of the Rosary‚ across the river Para-
guay. More or sewer oxen may be tied to the

bark, according to the size of it. Sometimes .

the herd of beasts is surrounded by long barks
or skiffs on every side, lest, when weary
of swimming‚ they should float down with the
stream, and wander from that part of the
shore that had been fixed on sor their ascent.
