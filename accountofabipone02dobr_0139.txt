CHAPTER XIV.

OF THE FORM AND MATERIALS OF CLOTHING, AND OF
THE FABRIC OF OTHER UTENSILS.

Tuosss persons are egregiously mistaken, who
imagine that all the AmericanS‚ without distinc-
tion, wear no other clothes than those in which
they were born. This error seems to have
arisen from the misrepresentations of pictures
or engravings, in which every American Indian
is pourtrayed like a hairy Satyr‚ or like one of
the Cyclops BronteS, or Steropes, or naked
Pyracmon. I do not deny that there do exist
