HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 131

Turkey carpet, worthy of noblemen's houses in
Europe. The loom and the instruments of
which it consists are confined to a few reeds
and sticks. The American women seem to have
a natural talent for making various useful ar-
ticles. They can mould pots and jugs of various
forms of clay, not With the assistance of a turn-
ing machine, like potters‚ but With their hands
alone. These clay vessels they bake‚ not in an
oven, but out of doors, placing sticks round
them. They cannot glaze them with lead, but
they first dye them of a red colour, and then
rub them with a kind of glue to make them
shine. There is never any snow, and very
little frost, in the region inhabited by the Abi—
pones: but when the South wind blows hard,
the air becomes very pierofflg, and sometimes
intolerably so to persons thinly clad. The
Abipones shield themselves from the cold With
a cloak made of otters' skins. This garment,
which is likevvise square, is laboriously and ele-
gantly made by the lwomen: whose business„¹
it is to strip off the skins of the otters, after they
have been caught by dog·S, and then fix them
to the ground with very slender pegs, that they
may not vvrinkle. After being dried, they are
painted red, in square lines like a dice box.
The Indian women cannot dress hides like cur· ’
