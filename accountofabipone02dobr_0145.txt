HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 133

the Abipones are bathed in sweat, the otters'

In former ages the Americans preferred
nakedness to clothing so greatly, that they re-
fused or threw away the garments offered them

hat, some pieces of red linen or eloth, or a
string of glass-beads, and they will pay you
the profoundest homage and obedience. Day
and night did the Abipones pester us with the

no surer method of gaining the hearts of the ·

Indians than giving them clothes. No Ame-

bodies of the Indians. If both or either of these
articles be wanting, they will return to their
