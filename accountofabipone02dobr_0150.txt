which they all rise up together at one moment»
Each then courteously takes leave of the master
of the house in these wordS‚ Lahilcyegarilr .· now
Ι am going from you; to which he replies, La
miclzerods now you are going from me. The
plebeian Indians say Lalnflc, now Ι am going.
When at the door of the house, that is, at
the place where they go out, for they have
no doors‚ they turn to the master, and say,
Ταυιταῗα, Ι shall see you again, an expression
commonly made use of in our country. They
would think it quite contrary to the laws of
good-breeding, were they to meet any one,
and not ask him where he was going: so that
the word fllielcctzee? or Illielcauchite? where are
you going? resounds in the streets.

The men think polygamy and divorce allow-
able, from the example of their ancestors, and
of other American nations3 but very few of
the Abipones indulge in this liberty. Re-
pudiation is much more common than a plu-
rality of wives, But very many are content
with one wife during the whole of their lives.
They think it both wicked and disgraceful to
have any illicit connection with other women;
so that adultery is almost unheard-of amongst
them. Both boys and girls display a native
hilarity in their countenances, yet you never
see them in company, or talking together.
