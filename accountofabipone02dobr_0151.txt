msromr or THE ABIPONEs. 139

Some time after my arrival, I played on the
flute in the open street. The crowd of women
were delighted with the sweetness of a musical
instrument they had never before seen ; and the
youths flocked in numbers to hear it; but as
soon as they approached, the women every
one disappeared. The custom of bathing in a
neighbouring stream is agreeable to them, and
practised every day, except when the air is too
cold. But do not imagine that, as syrens and
dolphins are seen sporting on the same waves in
the ocean, males and females swim and wash in
the same part of the lake, or river. According
to the Abiponian custom, the different sexes!
have different places assigned them. Where the
women bathe, you cannot find the shadow of a
man. Above a hundred women often go out
to distant plains together to collect various
fruits, roots‚ colours, and other useful things,
and remain four or eight days in the country,
without having any male to accompany them
on their journey, assist them in their labours,
take care of the horses, or guard them amidst
the perils of wild beasts, or of enemies. Those
Amazons are sufficient to themselves, and think
they are safer alone. Ι never heard of a single
woman being torn to pieces by a tiger, or bitten

by a serpent: but I knew many men who were
’ killed in both wayS.
