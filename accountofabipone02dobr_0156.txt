could belong to, clearly discovered that a short
time previous, four Spaniards had been slain in
that place, and that the perpetrator of the
murder was a Spaniard, a captive, and leader ,
of the AbiponeS, and more formidable to the
Spanish nation than any Abipon. Many things
worthy of relation will occur respecting this
base crew, respecting Almaraz, Casco, J uanico,
a Negro of CorrienteS‚ J nan J oseph‚ an Ytatin-
gua Indian, and above all, respecting Juan
Diaz Caeperlahachin. This last, an Abipon by
origin, had been taken in war by the SpaniardS,
when a boy, and afterwards converted to their
religion. During twenty years which he spent
in the town of* St. Iago, in the service of the
Spaniard J uan Diaz Ca'eperlahachin, he evinced
much probity‚ and even piety. Every year, in
the last week of Lent, did he publicly mangle
his back with a bloody scourge3 but after
having effected his escape, and got back to his
countrymen, he became the scourge of the
Spaniards, and shedding torrents of their blood,
obtained a high renown amongst his own
people‚ to whom his knowledge of roads and
places rendered him eminently useful; for, in
expeditions having the slaughter of the Spa-
niards for their object, no man discharged the
offices of scout and leader more gloriously or
more willingly than he. Peace being subse*
