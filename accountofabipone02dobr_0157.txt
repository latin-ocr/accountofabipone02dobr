HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 145

quently established with the Spaniards, and
the colony of Concepcion founded for the Abi-
poneS, this man, who was acquainted with many
languages, performed the part of interpreter
there3 abusing which office to his own pur-
poses, he lest no stone unturned to render the
friendship of the Spaniards suspicions, the
religion of Christ, and υς, the teachers of that
religion, odious to the Abiponian catechumens.
Feigning‚ however, piety and friendship, this
crafty knave succeeded in gaining an excellent
character amongst the credulous Spaniards
and Abipones, though dangerous to both, and
perfectly intolerable to us who governed the
colony. But lo! the pestilent son had a still
more pestilent mother. This woman, the chief
of all the female jugglers, a hundred years
old, venerable to the people on account of
her wrinkles‚ and formidable by reason of the
magic arts she was thought to be acquainted
with, never ceased exhorting her countrymen
to shun and detest the church‚ our instruction,
and baptism, even when administered to dying
infants. Behold! a mother worthy of her son
-—-a bad egg of a bad crow ἱ But the vengeance
of God overtook this accursed old woman.
Flying from the town, with a band of her
hordesmen, she was killed by the Mocobios‚
