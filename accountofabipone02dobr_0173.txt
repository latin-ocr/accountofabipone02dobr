horse, Yahzic, my face. They make frequent
use of the Greek K. They pronounce N like
the SpaniardS, as if the letter I was added to
it: thus, Espafiol must be pronounced Espcmiol.
, The Abipones say ᾹῙεηείαῆὶ, it is within; Yo-
amcaclziiii, the inner part is good. The legiti-
mate pronunciation of this and other letters can
only be learned vimi voce.

Great attention must be paid to all the diffe—
rent accents and points, for the omission of a
point, or the variation of an accent, gives a word
a totally different meaning, thus: Ηεὲί, Ι fly3
H'e'k't, Ι speak3 Ηάίεη, I despise3 Hateri, I hit
the mark. This language abounds in very long
wordS, consisting of ten, twenty, or more letters.
The accents repeated in the same word show
where the voice should be raised and where
lowered: for the speech of this nation is very
much niodulated, and resembles singing. The
accents alone are scarce sufficient to teach the
pronunciation. It would not be amiss to sub-
join musical notes to each of the syllableS‚ un-
less a master supersedes the necessity of this
artifice by teaching it υἰυά voce. It may be as
well to give some examples of accentS. Ha-
milzcgemlsin', Debciyalsailcim Raregf‘dgremaFaclziti,
Oahe‘rlcailfin'. These are names of AbiponeS.
