162 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONE&

Nic-azeagrm‘iiapegafulge, I intercede for thee.
HemolsdehiJJiicApegioa, thou praisest me. Here
are words of twenty letters. You will not find
many monosyllables. The tall Abipones like
words which resemble themselves in length.

They have a masculine and a feminine gender,
but no neuter. A knowledge of the genders is‘
to be gained by use alone. Gralzazclc2i‚ the sun,
is feminine with them, like the German Die
Somze. Graaals, the moon, is masculine, as our
Der Illomle. Some adjectives are of both gen-
ders, as Nat), which is evil, both masculine and
feminine. Neci), good, of both genders. Iu
others every gender has its own termination, as
Ariailc, good, noble, max. Ανίαμὲ, good, noble, γ
fem. Cacllergailt, an old man3 Caclzergayb, an
old woman.

The nouns have no cases, A letter prefixed
to the noun sometimes indicates the case: as,
Ayni, I; flI'agmi, to me; Akami, thou3 M ³akami,
to thee.

The formation of the plural number of nouns
is very difficult to beginners ; for it is so various
that hardly any rule can be set down. I give
you some examples ε
