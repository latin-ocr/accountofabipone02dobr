mswoms oF THE ABIPONES. 165

But these examples are sufficient to show the
multiplied variety of the second person.
Amongst the Guaranies too, the possessives are
affixed to the nouns, but this occasions no diffi-
culty, because 1116-111111311011 is regular: thus,
Tuba, a father. Cheruba, my father. Nderuba,
thine. Τ aba, his. Gaba, theirs. Tay, a son.
Clzeraff, mine. Nderay, thine. Taff, his. Guaff,
theirs. Che is prefixed to nouns for the first
person, and Nde for the second, without varia-
tion. Likewise in the plural they say Nande,
or Oreruba, our father. Pendzcba, your father.
Ταύα, or Gaba, their father. In all other sub-
stantives these particles supply the place of
possessives.

The following observation must be made on
the possessive nouns of the AbiponeS. If they
866 any thing whose owner they do not know,
and wish to be made acquainted with, they
enquire to whom it belongs in various ways.
If the object in question be animate, (even
though it only possess vegetable life,) as
wheat, a horse, a dog, a captive, &c. they say
Cahcmzi lelci? whose property is this ζ’ to which
the other will reply‚ Fls), mine. Grelk, thine.
Lem, his. On the other hand, if the thing be
1113111111316, 38 3 811631, 3 garment, food, &c.
they say Kahami Ιεαίὰηι, 10 whom does this
