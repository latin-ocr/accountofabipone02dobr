chin but as they are unable to express second,
tlzird, fourth, in their language, instead of these
numberS, they place before the commandmentS,

lecina, ᾅτ. They have, however, words signi-
fying first and last, Endm εαΙιὲΙε, that which goes
before, and Ihag·elzek, that which comes last.
They have only two distributive numerals:
each Ιῇἰίαναρὲ, and Ιῇὀαῖςαίαρὲ, which answers
to the Latin, bini. Liszoalca psallat, means twice.
Elccitarapelr, and sometimes Hasce lcen, once.
This is the extent of the Abiponian arithmetic,
and the whole of their scanty supply of num-
bers. Scarce richer are the Guarany Indiam,
who cannot go beyond the number four. They
call One, Petey. Two, Illolcoff. Three, Mbo-
lzapi. Four, Irmzdy. First, Iyipibae. Second,
Imomolcoyndccba. Third, Imombohapilzaba. Fourth,
Imoz'mrundfflzaba. *Singulc‘, Peteſjtey. Bim', Mo-
lcomeokogJ. T erni, Mbohdpilzapl. Quaterni, Imm-
dy rundy'. Once, Peteyu yebi. Twice, Molsoj
yebi, 850. The GuaranieS, like the AbiponeS,
when questioned respecting a thing exceeding
four, immediately reply, Mlipapalzabi, or Nali-
papalzai, innumerable. But as a knowledge of
numbers is highly necessary in the uses of civi-

'x' Ι give the original Latin in this and other places, where rhc

English does not fully express the meaning.
