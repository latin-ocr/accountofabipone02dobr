lized life, and above all, in confession, the Gua-
ranies were daily taught at church to count
in the Spanish language, in the public explana-
tion, or recitation of the catechism. On Sun-
day, the whole people used to count from one
to a thousand, in the Spanish tongue, in the
church. But it was all in vain. Generally
speaking, we found the art of music, painting,
and sculpture, easier learnt than numberS. They
can all pronounce the numbers in Spanish, but
are so easily and frequently confused in count-
ing, that you 'must be very cautious how you
credit what they say in this matter.

For the conjugation of verbs, no paradigm
can be given3 as the singular number of the
present tense of the indicative mood differs in
almost all words, and is more difficult to learn
than the augments of the Greek verbs. The
second person particularly takes new letterS,
not only in the beginning, but also in the mid-
dle, and the end, as will appear from the exam-
ples which Ι shall lay before you. ¹
