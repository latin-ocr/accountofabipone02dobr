174 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

¹ your ears with so many long savage words.
From the little which I have written, you will
collect that the inflexions and variations os the
second person in particular can only be learnt
by use, not by rules. The other tenses of the
indicative mood, and indeed all the moods of
every conjugation, give little trouble to learners,
being formed simply by adding a few syllables,
or particles, to the present of the indicative:
for instance 2—-

Present tense. Rilcapz't, I love.

The imperfect is wanting.

Preterite. Rikapz‘t kam, or lcam'gra, Ι have loved.
Preterpluperfect. Kdnigra gehe rz'lcapz't, I had loved formerly.
F uture. Rikapitdm, Ι will love.

You add the same particles to the second and
third persons, without changing them in any
other respect: thus—

Grlcapz'clzz', thou lovest,

Grlcapiclzi lcan, thou hast loved. .
Grlcapz'clzi lcanigra gelre, thou hadst loved.
Grlsapiclziczm, thou wilt love.

For the syllable am is what distinguishes the
present from the future.

The imperative mood undergoes no mutation
either in the present or future tense. Thus,
hasten thou3 Gralzdlgali, which is also the
second person of the indicative, thou hasten-
est. Eichi, do thou: Grlcapiclzi, love thou:
