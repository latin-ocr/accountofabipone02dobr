participle, or by active verbs. When we say
that a thing· is lost or ended, they say that the
thing has perished, ceased, does not appear, &c.
Yz'tihalc oal0c>‚ or chitlgilze: The ox hath perished,
or does not appear. In denying, the passive is
explained by an active verb only, with the
addition of the particle clzigat, or ckigichielcat:
thus: Itisnotknown: Chigatyaraigb. Yaraig&
is the indicative mood, present tense, third
person singular, of the active verb. That is not
eaten: Clzigat yailc. That is not usurped:
Cizigat eygcl. I was not informed: Chigat ri—
paclzigui. The horses were not well guarded,
therefore they perished: Illaclzlsa clzigat wlfelm-
yape end ahepegm maoge oaloe'ra. The stars
cannot be counted : Clzigiclzielcat ozalcatr'ez‘ eefflgrae.
What is not known, ought not to be told. Am ·
clzigat yaraige, clzigiclziclrat yaratapelcam, ᾇτ’.
