188 Hrsroavor THE ABIPONES.

The Abiponian tongue might not improperly
be called the language of circumstances, for it
affixes various particles to words to denote the
various situations of the subject of discourse:
either hegem, above; asli, below; aigil, around3
hagam, in the water3 onge, out of doors3 alge,
or elge, on the surface‚ &c. The thing will be
made plainer by examples: We use the same
word is when we say, God is in heaven, z's on
earth, is in the water, is every where. The
Abipones always add some new particle to the
verb, to indicate situation, thus: Dios meneta-
leeg-em ken hipigbm, God dwells above in heaven :
menetmii ken αὰῖοὰ, dwells below in the earth:
mefietczlzagam ken emfficzp, dwells in the water,
δερ. llere the particles aiei, lzegem, and hagani
are affixed to the verb menetai. But now attend
to something else. How great is the variation
of the verb to follow*! I followa person coming,
Hazciretaigit. I follow one departing, Hauirac).
I follow with my hand what is beneath' me,
I-Iamfrmw, what is above me, Hauirilzqgeme'ege.
I do not follow with my eyes, Chic lecondage.

Ι do not follow with my understanding, (I do .

not comprehensi) (shig- iictemdtaigit. I follow, I
hit with an arrow, Naten. Some going out
follow otherS‚ Ῡάιισνάαίὰ, or J‘Pmirbtapegetcz
