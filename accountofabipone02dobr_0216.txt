204 HISTORY OF THE ABlPONES.

ceased are presently abolished. During the
first years that I spent amongst the AbiponeS,
it was usual to say Hegmallcam kahamcitelc?
When will there be a slaughtering of oxen? On
account of the death of some Abipon, the word
kalzamcitelc was interdicted, and, in its stead,
“ they were all commanded, by the voice of a
cryer, to say, Hegmallcam ncgerlcatd? The word
nihirenals, a tiger‚ was exchanged for apani-
gelzalc; pesce, a crocodile, for Ιεαερνῆαἷε, and Καά-
ma, SpaniardS, for leucu, because these words
bore some resemblance to the names of Abi-
pones lately deceased. Hence it is that our
vocabularies are so full of blots, occasioned by
our having such frequent occasion to obliterate
interdicted wordS‚ and insert new ones. Add
to this another thing which increases the diffi-
culty of learning the language of the Abipones.
Persons promoted to the rank of nobles are
called H beheri, and Nelef'eycate, and are distin-
guished from the common people even by their
language. They generally use the same words,
but so transformed by the interposition, or ad-
dition of other letters, that they appear to be-
long to a different language. The names of men
belonging to this class, end in I22; those of the
women, who also partakc of these honours, in
En. These syllables you must add even to
substantives and verbs iu talking with them.
