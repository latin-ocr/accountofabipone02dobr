206 fflsronv or THE ABIPONES.

ayte means many, and apatciye is derived from
napata, a mat, which they use to cover their
tents with3 aud so great is the multitude of
gnats in the lands of the Abipones that the
inhabitants seem not only covered but op-
pressed by them. To drink with the Riikahes
is expressed by ηεὲτ, with the N akaiketergehes
by nahem. The latter call a head Lapm‘zilc,
the former Lemafut. The Yaaucanigas, in the
use of words, sometimes imitate one, sometimes
the other3 but in a few they differ from both.
The rest call the moon Grazcclc, but they, by
antonomasia, name it Eergffiailc, a star. The
rainbow is called by the rest, Ocihetd, but by
the YaaucanigaS, Apiclz. But this variety cre-
ates neither difficulty nor wonder. The Teu-
tonic language is used by many nationS, but
how greatly does it differ in different provinces,
not only in dialect but also in words! How
different is Tuscan from the languages spoken
at Milan, Savoy, and Venice! How different is
Castilian from the languages of Arragon, An-
dalusia, N avarre, and Valencia!
