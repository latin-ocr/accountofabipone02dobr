though we thought no medicine capable of sa-
ving her life. The blood which flowed, mixed
with milk, being wiped up, the wound was
washed with hot wine, and anointed with hen’s
fat. N umbers of people assembled to witness
this mournful spectacle. Mixed with the
crowd came a juggler physician, who gave the
husband of the wounded woman a horn, de·-
siring him to discharge his urine into it, and
was immediately and plentifully obeyed. He
gave the warrn urine to the woman to drink,
who made no hesitation, but swallowed it to
the last drop. The juggling Hippocrates then
turned to my companion and said: “ Do you
know why I prescribed fresh urine? In order
that the wounded woman may vomit up the
ἡ blood trickling from the wound to the inmost
parts of the body, which would otherwise
putrefy, and cause the lungs and other parts to
putrefy also.’' The event verified his predic-
tion. The woman was cleared by vomiting.
The deep wound, being daily anointed with
hen’s fat, and having the leaves of the cabbage,
which we call silsse lerant, applied to it to pre—
vent inflammation, healed in a few days, and,
excepting the sear, no inconvenience, trouble,
or pain resulted from it. The surgeons of our
country will doubtless laugh at the application
of hen's fat, and perhaps question its efficacy in
