‘trickling from the nostrils were symptoms of
the reigning disorder; the same signs too indi-

that disease in mules, especially if salt were
given them to lick. The paunches of the oxen
slain to seed ’ the Indians are daily thrown out,
along with the boweIS‚ into an open place,
where all the horses and mules eagerly crowd
to lick the garbage, because a sort of salt and
nitre is created by the blood of which they are '
excessively fond. Therefore, whilst this dread-
sul murrain raged in our territories we daily
sprinkled those entrails with salt, the salubrity
of which is proved by the circumstance, that
whilst numbers died 1n the neighbouring estateS,
very few sickened, and many recovered with
us in the town of St.J0ach1m

fine people, truly! They have made liberal com-
pensation for the infinity of gold and silvei· they
have taken from us, by leaving us the plague os
the small-pox.'' Indeed it is a well known fact
that the number of Indians who have died of this.
