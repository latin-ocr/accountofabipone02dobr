flls'roav OF THE AfflPONEs. 247

physicianS. Whilst I was at the Cordoban
estate of St. Catharine belonging to the J esuits,
at the approach of night, we beheld a fiery
meteor, which bore the appearance of a very
wide bearn, and rolled sparkling through the
midst of heaven to the opposite horizon. The
Spanish strangers afterwards declared that it
was visible to the whole province, and judged
it portentous. We, who had learnt a sounder'
philosophy, gazed at that sudden splendour as
calmly as at a firework, though it did in reality
prove calamitous‚ being either the cause or the
sign, or, at any rate, the concomitant of a deadly
catarrh which prevailed over the whole of Tu-
cuman, and in two years carried off a great
number of Spaniards and Negroes. Almost at
the same time when the fiery exhalation was
seen, this epidemic disease, as they say, began.
Though this dangerous pestilence visited all
the cities without distinction, yet I think it
raged with particular violence in the estates.
Travelling from Cordoba to Sta. Fe, I met
crowds of Spaniards carrying horns filled with
the urine of sick persons for the inspection of
the Cordoba empirics3 for there are no real
physicians in the whole provinces. You would
hardly believe what saith the lower orders of
Spaniards place in the inspection of urine, and

how much they are dcceived in this matter.
