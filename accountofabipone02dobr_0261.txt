that they cure every kind of disease with one
and the same medicine. Let us examine their
method of healing. They apply their lips to the
part affected, and suck it, spitting after every
suction. At intervals they draw-up their breath
from the very bottom of their breast, and blovv
upon that part of the body which is in pain.
That blowing and sucking are alternately re-
peated. If the whole body languishes, if it
burns with malignant heat, if it is seized with
measles or small-pox, four or five of these har-
pies fly to suek and blovv it, one fastening his
lips on the arm, another on the side, a third
and fourth on the feet. If a child eries, or re-
fuses the breast, the mother gives him to a
juggler to be sucked. This method of healing
is in use amongst all the savages of Paraguay
and Brazil, thatI arn acquainted with, and, ac-
cording to Father Jean Grilletâ€š amongst the
Galibe Indians. I have known matter sueked
