252 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

after seeing so many children die in consequence
of it.

Amongst the Payaguas there exists a law
that if any of them dies of a disease, the phy-
sician who undertook his cure shall be put to
death by the arrows of the assembled people3
and being desperately addicted to revenge, they
are steadfast in the execution of this cruel law.
During my residence in the city of Asumpcion,
an 'unhappy physician atoned sor the death
of his patient by his own. Were this law in
force amongst the Abipones, fewer of them
would profess themselves followers of Galen3
they would shun the dangerous vprofession of
medicine, and physicians would cease to grow
like sunguses in a night. Of this Î™ am quite
sure, that in every Abiponian horde there are
more physicians than sick persons: deterred by
no danger of'loss of fame or life, and certain os
reward, they besiege the beds of the sick, and
suck away their strength in every disease.
When questioned on the patient's danger, they
make the happiest forebodings. If the event

turn out contrary to their prognostiCS, they ,

have always a ready excuse: the disease was a >
fatal one, or their skill was baffled by the ma-
gical arts of some other juggler3 the matter
rests here, for it would be a crime to doubt the
excuse of a juggler.
