HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 263

and partridges, that he may render his breath
wholesomer and'stronger to suck and blow the
body of his patient. Whilst the physician
feasts sumptuously, the sick man has insipid
half—boiled maize given him to eat. If he dis-
likes this, no one will exhort the poor wretch to
take food, so that more persons die of hunger
than of the disease. At his first coming, the
physician overwhelms the sick man with an
hundred questions ε “ Where were you yester-
day ?'’ says he. “ What roads did you tread ’ἐ
Did you overturn the jug, and spill the drink
prepared from maize? What? Have you im-
prudently given ¹the fiesh of a tortoise, stag, or
boar, to be devoured by dogs ?” Should the sick
man confess to having done any of these things,
“It is well,” replies the physician, “we have
discovered the cause of your disorder. The soul
of that beast having entered your body torments
you even now, and is, alas! the origin of the
pains you feel.” The savage takes this for an
oracle. The cure is immediately set about.
The juggler sucks the afflicted part once, twice,
and three times. Then muttering a doleful
charin, he knocks the floor on which the sick
man is lying, with a club, to srighten away the
soul of that animal from his patient's body. A
crueller method of curing was once customary

amongst the Chiquitos.
