264 msronY oF THE ABIPONES.

Î‡ When a husband fell ill, they used to kill the
wife, thinking her the cause of his sickness, and
foolishly imagining that, when she was removed,
he would be sure to recover. At other times
they consulted their physicians, which of the
female jugglers occasioned the disease. These
men, actuated either by desire of vengeance or
interested motiveS, named whomsoever they
chose, and were not required to bring any proofs
of the guilt of the accused. The sentence of a
juggler was an oracle, and people assembled
from all parts to put it in execution. Such

were the Chiquitos before they were civilized
by the J esults
