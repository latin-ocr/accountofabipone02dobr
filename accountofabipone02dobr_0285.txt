CHAPTER XXVI.

DF THE MOURNING, THE EXEQUIEs, AND FUNERAL CERE-
M0N1Es OF THE ABIPONES.

OF those things which the Abipones do to
*testify their grief, according to the customs
established by their ancestorS, some tend to
obliterate the memory of the defunct, others to
perpetuate it. All the utensils belonging to the
lately deceased are burnt on a pile. Besides
the horses killed at the tomb, they slay his
vsmall cattle if he have any. The house which
he inhabited they pull entirely to pieceS. His
widow, children, and the rest of his family re-
-move elsewhere; and having no house of their
own, reside for a time in that of some other
person, or lodge misera-bly under mats, They
had rather endure the injuries of the weather,
than, contrary to the laws of their countrymen‚
inhabit a commodious house that has been sad-
dened by the death of the dear master of it.
To utter the name of a lately deceased person
is reckoned a nefarious offence amongst the
Abipones3 if, however, occasion requires that
mention should be made of that person, they

say, “The man that does not now exist,’'
