noise you can conceive. To every three or four
gourds one of these drums answerS. But what
offends the ear most is the shouting of the
mourners. They modulate their voices, like
singerS, and make trills and quavers mingled
with groans. After chaunting some rnournful
staves in this manner they all cease at intervals,
and, changing their voices from the highest to
the lowest key, suddenly utter a very shrill
hissing. You would swear that a knife had
been laid to their throats.1 By this sudden
howl they signify that they are seized with
rage, uttering all sorts of imprecations on the
author of the death, whoever he be. Some-
times, intermitting this chaunt, they recite a few
verses in a declamatory tone, in which they
extol the good qualities and deeds of the de-
ceased, and in a querulous voice endeavour to
excite the compassion and vengeance of the
survivors. At other times they mingle tears
with their wailings, tears extorted not by grief,
but by habit, or, perhapS, by exhaustion. Most
of them carry about some little gift or remem-
