HISTORY OF THE ABIPONEs. 285

physicians, medieines, death, and sepulture of
the AbiponeS‚ it cannot be thought foreign to
the course of my history to treat of the serpents
and noxious insects which inflict death on many,
and. threaten it to all: it will also be agreeable
to Europeans to know by what means the
Americans defend themselves against serpentS,
or expel the poison of their wounds.
