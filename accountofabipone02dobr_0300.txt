288 HISTORY OF THE ABIPoNEs.

son gradually diffusing itself through all the
memberS. It takes away the use of the foot,
arm, ear, and eye on that side which has been
bitten, and presently, passing to the other,
causes extreme tortum, continual delirium, and.
acute painS, especially at the extremity of the
feet and hands, which contract a cadaverous
paleness from being deserted by the blood,
which is rendered torpid by the coldness of the
venom. All this Ι observed in two Guarany
youths who were bitten by a rattle-snake. Both
were under eighteen years of age, both were ro-
bust and of strong constitutions. The first
struggled with his pains twelve days, the other
fourteen, at the expiration of which period they
both died, the strength of the poison baffling
the virtue of the most established remedieS.
Whenever I heard of any person’s ¹being bitten
by a rattle-snake I immediately prepared him
sor death, by administering the sacrament to
him, before the delirium began. An Indian
woman, in the flower of her age and strength,
was reduced to the last extremity by the pesti—
lential bite of one of these rattle-snakes. How—
ever, to the astonishment of all, she eseaped ’
death, but having lost the use of her limbs,
dragged on a miserable existence for many
years. ’
