places and shade. Another is the Curiyu‚ eight,
and often nine eils long, and of breadth cor-
responding to such great length. This water-
snake affords the Indians a dainty repast. Re-
markable above the rest is a serpent of enor-
mous size, but perfectly innocent in its nature.
The Ampalaba is thicker than a man's breast,
and larger than any water-snake. Itis of a light
reddish colour, and resembles the trunk of a very
large tree covered with moss. As Iwas travelling
through the territory of St. Iago, at the banks
of a lake near the river Dulce, my horse sud-
denly took frig-ht. Upon my enquiring of my
companion the occasion of the animal's terror,
he replied, “ What, Father! did you not see the
Ampalaba snake lying on the shore ?'' I had seen
him, but had taken him for the trunk os a tree.
Fearing that the horse would be alarmed and
throw me, I did not think proper to stay and
examine the great sparkling eyeS, short but
very acute teeth, horrid head, and many-co-
loured scales of the monster. These serpents
live under water, but come frequently on shore,
and even climb lofty trees, They never attack
men, and it is most likely that they are devoid
of poison. All however agree that Ampalabas
are fond of rabbits, goats and does, which they
attract with their bre-ath, and swallow whole.
