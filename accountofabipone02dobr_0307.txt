MORE ΟΝ THE SAME SUBJECT3 AND RESPECTING OTHER
INSECTS.

THE Jesuit Eusebius Nierenberg speaks of a
stupid snake, which, from the description, I
take to be the same as the Ampalaba. ‘⁶ It is
the thickness of aman‚” says he, “ and twice as
long. It inhabits rocks and caves, (perhapswhen
rivers and pools are wanting,) and feeds upon
animals, which it attracts with its breath. Some
IndianS, in travelling‚ sat down upon it, taking
it for the trunk of a tree3 and it was not till the
snake began to move that they perceived what
an unstable and terrific seat they had chosen.
It is however reputed harmless. These snakes
are of such vast size, that eighteen soldiers sat
down upon one, thinking it to be a log of
wood. They lie in wait for stags, which they
attract by the force of their breath, a power
they do not possess over men. After squeez-
ing the stag· to death, they lick it all over from
head to foot, in order that they may swallow
it more easily3 but suffer the head, which the
horns prevent them from swallowing‚ to re-

main in their mouth till it putrcfics. Ants some·
