Ι have often wondered that certain of the an-
cients recommended fire to keep off serpents, hav-
ing found them, on the contrary, to be-attracted
byit. We continually see them creep to the fire,
and steal* into warm apartments for the sake of
the heat. Virgil has justly given snakes the
epithet of frigid. The more copious and virulent
their poison is, the intenser is the cold they
labour under. Hence, in persons bitten by
serpents, the blood congeals‚ and the extre-
·mities of the body stiffen and grow cold, as the
circulation cannot reach them. That serpents
love heat we know from daily experience. In the
deserts we often were obliged to pass the night
in the open air: on these occasionS, no sooner
was the fire kindled than we saw the snakes con-
cealed in the vicinity approach to warm them-
selves. Whenever the south wind renders the
nights rather cold, they creep under the horse-
cloths lying on the ground. When the earth
is chill, serpents climb on to the roofs of houses
to bask in the sun, and thence are induced by
the sharp night-air to slip into the apartments
below, to the imminent danger of the occupantS.
