of serpents. Throvving themselves carelessly
on the ground, they sleep soundly without a
sear or a thought about serpents, and are often
awakened with a scream by the bite of one.
When travelling-bare-footed they employ their
eyes in watching birds in the air and monkeys
in the treeS, when they ought, at every step,
to examine the dangerous ground they are
treading. The Abipones, from being an eques-
trian people, and more circumspect, seldomer
suffer from serpents than the Guaranies, who
always walk on foot, and use less caution. In
the town of St. J oachim, where the climate is
very hot, and the land is surrounded with
marshes, rivers, and woods‚ venomous animals
are unusually numerous. Scarce a week passes
that some Indians are not “bitten by serpents.
During the eight years that I spent in this town
a vast number of persons were bitten by various
serpentS, but, with the exception of two youths
who were killed by a rattle-snake, not a single
individual died: 311 were healed by the use of
one and the same remedy. Now listen atten-
