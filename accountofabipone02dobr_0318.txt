celestial, and almost miraculous‚ medicine, which
is as unknown out of Paraguay, as it is useful

to the Paraguayrians. Itis a very white flower,

extremely like a lily in its leaves, stalk, blossom,
and scent, except that it is smaller. The Spa-
niards call it nard. It grows in all soils, flou-
rishes at every part of the year, and is neither
destroyed by long drought‚ nor by hoar frost.
I never could meet with this flower either in
European gardens‚ or in books treating of
flovvers‚ and have found the most scientific
herbalists utterly unacquainted with it. After
diligently examining every species of nard, I
perceived that the Paraguayrian nard could
not be referred to any of them. The root of
this flovver, either dried or fresh, is cut into
small pieces and steeped in brandy. Part of
this infusion‚ together with the root, is applied
to the wound, and the rest taken inwardly by
the patient. It is generally sufficient to do
this once. But if it be necessary to repeat it a
second and a third time, the force of the poison
is destroyed, the swelling subsides, and the
wound heaIS. The sooner you apply this re-
medy, the quioker and more certainly you will '
repress the progress of the poison. Taught by
the experience of eighteen years, Ι affirm it to
be superior to all other remedies. With it we
have triumphed over the poison of every snake
