swallow its juice, and smoke it through a reed,
giving him likevvise a vial of brandy to drink.
The poison at length was so much repressed by
these trifling remedies that the sick man reco'-
vered his strength sufficiently to pursue his
journey to the town. The warmth of the
brandy counteracts the cold of the poison, and
restores the heat of the stomach and of the blood.
Father Gumilla declares that serpents will die if
a tobacco leaf be thrust into their mouths. We
learn from the same author that, in the new
kingdom of Granada, the Americans drink gun-
powder mixed with brandy to cure the bites of
serpentS, and that it produces the desired effect.
The Abipones‚ Mocobios, and Tobas, as soon as
they feel themselves bitten by a serpent, cover
the vvound with virgin wax, vvhich is thought
to absorb the poison. At another time they
have it sucked out by their physicians. They
sometimes serape a crocodile's tooth, drink the
dust in water, and at the same time bind a
whole crocodile's tooth very tight on to the
open vvound. Our druggist at Cordoba, wish-
ing to try the virtue of this remedy, gave an

equal quantity of violent poison to tvvo dogs, ’

tying a crocodile's tooth round the neck of one,
and not round that os the other, and they say
that, whilst the latter diod in a very few hours,
the former recovered by means of the tooth.
