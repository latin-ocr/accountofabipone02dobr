HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 309

The Abipones surround the neck of a dog that
has been bitten by a serpent with os'trich fea-
therS, and they told me that their ancestors
looked upon that as a remedy.

The Portugueze extol the pieclra de cobra,
which is of a grey, and sometimes of a black
colour, and of various sizes, as the magnet of
poisons: for in the same manner that load-
stone attracts iron, this stone, when applied to
a wound, absorbs all the venom. That it may
serveagain for the same purpose it is immersed
in milk, into which the poison is discharged.
The ancient physicians thought garlick an ex-
cellent remedy for venomous bites. The effi-
cacy of this plant against poisons was proved
by an experiment of my own. A Guarany, as
he was working in the garden, was bitten in the
foot by a hairy spider, such as I have described,
and imprudently neglected to mention the cir-
cumstance. The poison beginning to operate,
he felt his thigh swell, with pain in the stomach,
and suspecting his danger, came to me for ad-
vice. Î™ ordered a little beef broth to be boiled
with plenty of garlick, which taken by the sick
man immediately repressed the poison, the
swelling, and the pain. Nor am I averse to
the prescription of Dioscorides, who thinks that
radish juice should be drunk on these occasions.
