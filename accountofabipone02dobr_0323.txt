HISTORY OF THE ABlPONEs. 311

as 3 shield, pursues and kills serpents, but if it
be wounded in the contest eats this herb as a
medicine. The ypipo moroti, and bcgjzcco cle Gua-
yaquil, have the same property. The roots of
the urucuj, jurepeba, jaborandi, &c. are highly
conducive to excite perspiration, by Which the
poison is expelled. I do not deny the validity
of these remedies, but, with the leave of physi-
cians, ancient as well as modern, I still think
nard root preferable to them all, for it has been
the salvation of numbers, not only of men, but
of beasts. As the cattle seed in the open air,
day and night, every part of the year, they are
not unfrequently bitten by serpentS, scolopen-
dras, and spiders. Blood dropping from the
nostrils is the sign of a poisonous wound.
Brandy mixed with nard root poured in time
down their throats was of great use, but after
the poison had diffused itself over all the mem-
bers of animals we generally found medicine
unavailing.
