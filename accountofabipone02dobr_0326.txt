314 HISTORY oF THE ABIPONES.

hot a climate. Though the fat of these
animals‚ even when fresh, like the rest of the
flesh, exhales a most abominable odour, yet
when mixed in water, it is drank by the
Abipones with the utmost avidity. In some
of the Guarany Reductions, peach leaves are
used to expel worms bred by flies.

The natives of northern regions will hardly
conceive, and natural historians scarce credit
the breeding of such dangerous worms from
flies3 but the Americans witness it daily, and
deplore its fatal effects not only on themselves,
but on cattle. When we killed a cow or a
sheep at sun-rise, the flies have been seen
swarming round the flesh ; soon after we have
found it covered with a kind of whitish seed,
and by sun-set the meat became stinking‚ full
of worms, and unfit to be eaten. Those who
wish to preserve meat uninjured, should either
cut it into very small pieces and dry it in
the air, or hang it up in the shade in a net, or
wicker basket, so that it may be exposed to the
air, without being accessible to flies. Should

a horse's back be injured by the hardness of the ·

saddle‚ or by long riding, the flies will swarm
thjther as if bidden to a feast, and breed innu-
merable worms, which mangle the horse, and in
a few days destroy him. Blood bursting from
an ulcer is a sign that worms are within. ln
