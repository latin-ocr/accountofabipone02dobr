appearing very uneasy. The Indiam, when
consulted on the matter, answered that he was
swarming with worms. Under my inspection,
“ they tied the dog's mouth and feet, laid him
on the ground, and pressing the flesh where it
appeared swelled with both handS, squeezed
out the worm concealed underneath. Seven-
teen worms were thus taken from as many
different places, all of a white colour, thicker
than the seed of an apple, and about the length
of a man’s thumb nail. Astonished at the cir-
cumstance, I was told by the Indians that it
frequently happened to themselves. And, in-
deed, all Paraguay knows that the minutest
worms and flies have been the death of many
persons. Father Felix Villa-Garzia‚ during his
long search sor the Ytatinguas in the Tarumen-
sian woodS‚ contracted a disorder in his eye,
and was tormented by a fistula and the worms
engendered therein for the rest of his life: that
the heat of the sun, and various kinds of gnats
were the occasion of this disorder, is well
known.
