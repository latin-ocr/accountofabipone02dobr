But if the bladder be broken in the operation,
the humour effused from thence will occasion
further pain, and the nits‚ by being scattered,
will breed fresh worms in the same place.

from which it has been eradicated‚ not unfre-

remedied, becomes gangrenous. The nails of
the feet, which they frequently attack‚ always
decay and fall off, and, to preserve life, it is
often necessary to amputate the toeS. Those
who wish to guard against this inconvenience,
should study cleanliness in their houseS, for
the said worms derive their origin from dust,
