326 ffls'ronv OF THE ABIPONES.

where the air is not so hot, this noxious insect
is unknown3 indeed it is seen no where but in
the territories of Buenos-Ayres‚ and Cordoba
of the Tucumans. After passing six years in
Paraguay, Ι was only acquainted with it by
name, and it was not till my removal to the
colony of St. Ferffinand, that I began to see, to
suffer and to execrate this pest. Persons who
live in a place infested by these insectS‚ should
have their feet daily examined3 for however
troublesome this inspection may be, much
greater inconvenience will be incurred by the
neglect of it. At one sitting a boy will often
take out twenty or more worms, and when your
fingers and nails are almost all filled with holes,
and the soles of your feet so lacerated as to
prevent you from walk'mg a step without diffi-
culty, you will yourself deplore your neglect
and procrastination. I have known⁴ many per-
sons confined to their bcds for weekS, and
others entirely deprived of the use of their feet
on this account. Though these worms chiefly
attack the feet, yet they sometimes, with still
greater danger, crcep to the other parts of the
body, and make their nest in the arm or knee.

Dogs, from their always lying on the ground, ,

are most troubled with these insects3 but they
dexterously remove them from their flesh with
their tongues, and heal the wound by licking it.
