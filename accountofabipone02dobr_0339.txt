HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 327

Sows, tame monkeys, catS, goatS‚ and sheep, are
dreadfullytormented by them3 but horses, asses,
mules, and oxen, are protected against the com-
mon enemy by the hardness of their hoofs. The
Americans should take care to fill up the hollow
left by the bladder with tobacco-povvder‚ ashes,
or soap, otherwise the wound made by the
needle, and infected with the poison of the
insect, will become ulcerOUS, conceive matter,
and, on occasion of inflammation, or violent
motion of the feet, will end in a gangrene, or
St. Anthony's fire. Hen's fat and a cabbage
leaf applied to the feet, to allay the infiamma-
tion, have often been found of service. They
write that the BrazilianS‚ to keep off these
worms, anoint their feet with an oil expressed
from the unripe acorns of the acaju. Sailors
daub themselves with pitch for the same pur-
pose. All of us, in the sear of these and other
insects, wore sheepskin leggings, but we found
them weak and inefficient defences.

The common fleas of Europe, diffused like
aether throughout every part of the air, are not
only bred in Paraguay‚ but domineer most in-
solently here, as in their native soil. It is a
remarkable circumstance that the plain itself,
which is covered with grass, swarms with fleas.
