HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 329

towns of the Indians. Flying bugs, called bin-
chuccas, are common in Cordoba, and other
parts of Tucuman. By day they lurk in the
chinks of roofs and chests, but fly out at night
and make bloody war upon sleepers. They
affect the part upon which they fasten with an
intolerable heat, seeming rather to burn than
bite the body. The red spots caused by the
pain appear as if they had been raised by a
caustic. Fatigued with fifteen days hard riding,
through a continuous desert, and amid unceas-
ing showers, I reached the town of Salabina,
where repose was not only desirable, but
almost indispensable for me; yet the whole
night passed away without my being able to
obtain a wink of sound sleep. I felt all my
limbs pricked and heated‚ but was unable to
discover the cause of this unusual pain. When
day-light appeared, all who saw me covered
with red spots pitied my misfortune, and as-
sured me that the flying bugs were the cause of
it. In another journey I passed the night in
company with a noble priest‚ who, after we
had partaken of a light supper, set out with
me and his domestics to sleep in a neighbouring
field. In that part of the country this is both
customary and necessary, for in hot nights the
houses swarm with bugs to such a degree that
it is impossible to get any sleep in them.
