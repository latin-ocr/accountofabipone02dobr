330 mSTORY or THE ABIPONES-

Amongst pernicious insects no inconsiderable
place should be assigned to the garrapata,
which is about the size of a lentil, and in form
resembles a land tortoise, eiicept that it is more
spherical, wearing on its back a mail like that
animal. It is of a dark tawny colour, partly
variegated, has a flat body, eight little feet,
and a prominent head or proboscis, which it
inserts into the skin, fastening‚ at the same
time, the hooks of its feet into it, and whilst it
sucks blood from every part of the body, creates
an itching and inflammation, followed by swell-
ing and matter, which often lasts four days or
more, while the ulcer will hardly heal within a
fortnight. When the insect has fixed its head
deep into the fiesh, it is very difficult to pull it
out entire3 and if it remain sticking in the
flesh yon will be in a bad condition3 for the
venom will not be got rid of till matter has
flowed for a long time srorn that itching ulcer.
The plains and woods are filled with this insect‚
so hostile both to man and beast. Where you
see rotten leaves, or reeds, there yon will find
swarms of this little animal. 'When we tra-
velled in the woods to discover the hordes of
the savages, we disregarded tigers, serpents,
and carogna& in coinparison with these noxious
insects : it was our constant complaint that we
had not eyes enough to avoid them, nor hands
