that the sulphureous smoke may not be per-
mitted to escape. You then light all the sul-
phur you have at hand, by means of bellows,
and the smoke filling the whole cave will suffo-

successfully practised by many persons in Pa-
raguay. But if sulphur be wanting in these so-
litudes, or patience to use it, then grapes and
the productions of the trees and plains must fail
also. The ants will devastate every thing, and
elude all the arts of the cultivator, unless de-
stroyed by the smoke of sulphur.

It were to wrong the Paraguayrian antS, if,
after having so minutely described all the mis-
chief they commit, I were to be silent on their
benefitS. Some of the larger sort have 3 little
ball in the hind part of their bodies full of very
white fat, which, when collected, and melted
like butter, is eaten with pleasure both by In-
dians and Spaniards. Other very small ants,
in those shrubs which bear the quabyra-miri,
deposit 3 wax naturally white, and consisting of
small particles, which is used to make candles
for the use of the altar, and when lighted ex-

quickly melts, ancl though double the price of
any other wax is sooner consumed. There are
also ants that convey to their caves particles of
fragrant rosin, which serve for frankincense. In
