HISTORY OF TH Ε ABIPONES. 339

water was bad, and of a black colour; and, on
inspecting the vessel, found a toad boiled with
the water, which had given it that dark hue,
and was so swelled that it entirely choked up
the mouth of the vessel. In the colony of the
Rosary, which I founded on the banks of a
lake, there was the same abundance of toads.
Whilst I performed divine service the chapel
swarmed with them, and though many were
slain every hour of the day, for two years, their
numbers seemed rather to increase than dimi-
nish. A species of toad, called by the Spani-
ards escuerzos, and much larger than European
ones, are not only troublesome‚ but, when pro-
voked, dangerous: for by way of revenge they
squirt their urine at those by whom they are
offended, and if the least drop of this liquid en-
ter the eye it will immediately produce blind-
ness. It is moreover indubitable that not only
their urine, but their saliva, blood, and gall
possess a poisonous property. We learn from
creditable authors that the Brazilian savages
roast toads, and then reduce them to a powder,
which they infuse into the meat or drink of
their enemies to cause their death3 for it occa-
sions a dryness and inflammation of the throat,
together with vomiting‚ hiccups, sudden faint-
ing, delirium, severe pains in the joints and
stomach‚ and sometimes dysentery. Persons
