HISTORY OF THF. ABIPONES. 355

of wooden gauntlet. The quiver is made of
rusheS, and adorned with woollen threads of
various colours. The arrOWS, which are an 611
and a palm in length, consist osa reed, to which
a sharp point of bone, very hard wood‚ or iron
is prefixed. Wooden points are more formi-
dable than iron oneS, but those of bone, which
are made of a fox⁷s leg, are the most to be
dreaded of a113 for they break in being ex-
tracted, and the part remaining in the body
causes a swelling‚ and a very virulent ulcer,
which leaves the wounded person no rest„ Any
wood, from being imbued with a kind of native
poison, causes more pain and tumour than iron.
The Abipones never poison their arrows, as is
usual amongst many other people of Ame-
rica. The Chiquitos are dreaded by the
neighbouring savages on this account, that if
an arrow of theirs wound the outermost skin,
and bring the least drop of blood, all the limbs
will swell, and in the course of a few hours
death will ensue. The deadly poison in which
they dip their arrOWS, the Chiquitos‚ alone know
how to prepare from the bark of an unknown
tree, and to this day they reserve to themselves
the knowledge of the cruel mystery. In hunt-
ing too they kill wild animals with arrows
dipped in the same poison, and cutting out the
wounded part of the body, eat them with safety,
