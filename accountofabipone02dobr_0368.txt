of the Orinoco prepare a most fatal poison to
dip their arrows in.

The feathers which expedite the ssight of the
arrows are taken from the wings of crows, so
that when the Abipones went out to shoot these
birds we guessed that war was at hand. Each
feather is tied on both sides, to the extremity of
the reed, by a fibre of very slender thread. The
Vilelas excite the admiration of all Paraguay by
their skill in archery. They dexterously fasten
the feathers to the arrow with a glue made from
the bladder of the fish vagre, inserting the point
very lightly into the reed3 an artifice which ren—
ders their arrows extremely dangerouS‚ because
whilst the reed is extracted the point remains
sticking in the flesh. The Guaranies, less curi-
ous in these matters, apply the feathers of par-
rots, or other birds, to their arrows. When
more than four hundred shoot at a mark, at the
same moment, and they go to gather them up,
each knows his own by the colour os the
featherS. Every nation, in short, has a peculiar
