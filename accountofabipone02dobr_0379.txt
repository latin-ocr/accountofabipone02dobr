ffls‘ronv OF THE AB1PoNEs. 367

as it is possible to conceive. In every one
of the Abipones‚ you would ,behold a thunder-
bolt of war. Each thinks himself a Hector,
an EpaminondaS, a Hanniba13 and such they
might be believed by all who beheld their faces
covered with blood-red stains to render them
more terrific‚ their arms and breasts full of
scarS, and their threatening eyeS, and who
listened to their ferocious and slaughter-breath-
ing wordS. But could we look into their
breasts, we should perceive that they were
different within from what they appeared with-
out. We should discover a shell without a
kernel, an ass in a lion’s skin, an ignis fatuus
under thundering words, and vain rage unsup-
ported by strength. Though, no longer masters
of themselves, they crawl on the ground in a
state of intoxication, at your bidding they will
climb to Heaven itself, they will tear away the
hinges of the globe, and had all the human race
but one neck, like Caligula, they would end it
at a blow. Were they as courageous in battle,
as vaunting in their cupS, they would long since
have extinguished the race of Spaniards in
Paraguay. But as some one has observed‚
drunken bullies are better trumpeters than
soldiers. They are all empty sound. Amidst
their cups and their songs they are bold as
lionS, but in battle more cowardly than hares.
