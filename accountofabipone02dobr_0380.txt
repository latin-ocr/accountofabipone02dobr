368 HisTORY or THE AfflPONEs,

Whenever an Abipon dies by the hand of an
enemy, the nearest relation of the deceased
takes upon him to avenge his death. It is his
business to invite his countrymen and hordes-
men, or even the inhabitants of another horde,
to join their arms with his, to lead them against
the enemy, and, when the attack is made, to
- go first into battle. As they lend assistance to
friendly nations, they seek it in turn from them,
either when they are preparing for war, or when
they apprehend it from others whom they deem
themselves unequal toÂ¹ contend with alone.
But, as Europe so often experiences, little con-
fidence is to be placed in auxiliary forces.

The friendship of the Indians is notoriously

fickle and unsteady3 for, as they enter into
alliance merely with a view to their own advan-
tage, they will suddenly turn their backs on
their greatest friends, should the hope of the

smallest emolument preponderate.
