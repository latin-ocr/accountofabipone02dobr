374 HISTORY oF THE ABIPONES.

seven years that I spent amongst the Abi-
poneS, I regularly found that whenever we
passed sleepless nights in arms, sor fear os an
enemy, not so much as the shadow of one ever
approached3 and that when none osus suspected
any thing hostile, a formidable swarm ofsavages
fell upon our colony. An enemy is never more
to be dreaded than when he is feared the
least.
