HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 381

Another Spaniard, in the territory of CorrienteS,
seeing the court-yard of his house, which was
but slightly fortified with stakes, surrounded by
Abipones, turned his gun, perhaps not loaded,
towards them, threatening first one, then
another, by turns. This was more than suffi-
cient to frustrate the intended assault of the Abi-
pones. I knew a captain named Gorosito‚ who
did much service amongst the soldiers of St.
Iago. He made use of a gun from which you
could. not expect a single spark of fire, and on
being asked why he did not have it repaired,
replied that he thought that unnecessary. “ It
is sufficient‚” said he, “ to show even a useless
gun to the savages, who, not knowing it to be
defective, are terrified at the very sight of it.
Furnished with this gun, I have gained not only
security, but glory, in many skirmishes.'' But
I have no occasion for the testimonies and ex-
perience of others, having myself so often fright-
ened away troops of assaulting savageS, armed
with a gun which I never once fired.

On the other hand, how dangerous a thing it
is to fire guns inconsiderately, we have often
found on various occasionS, but above all in a
new Indian colony, where a few garrison sol-
diers guarded the borders of Tucuman, 011 ac-
count of the frequent incursions os the savages.
