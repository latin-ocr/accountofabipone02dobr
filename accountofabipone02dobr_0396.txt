384 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

manage arms unskilfully. Thus, if thirty artil-
lery soldiers should undertake the defenee of a
station, they ought to be divided into three
ranks, so that ten might fire their guns upon the
enemy, ten load, and the others reserve an equal
number loaded. By Which means they would
always have time to load their guns, and the
Indians would neVer want cause for sear. By
the eareful observance of this method‚ thirty
artillery soldiers might be sound sufficient to
rout and put to flight three hundred Amerieans.
But if three hundred artillery-men were to fire
all their guns at once, without killing any of the
enemy, they, on the other hand, might be over-
come by thirty savageS. For the Abipones,
like most of the Americans, are intimidated by
the most⁴ trifling slaughter of their companions :
if but one or two of them sall, the rest instantly
take to ssight, esteeming life far above the honour
of victory. How eomes it then that they are so
dreaded by other nations? Ι will explain this
in the next chapter.
