have no room left them for escape. Scipio
judged wisely that a flying enemy should be al-
lowed a passage. This precept is generally
obeyed by the Paraguayrian SpaniardS, who
often yielded the savages more liberty of escape
’ than need required. This Barreda found in an
hundred expeditioris which he headed against
the Abipones and MocobiOS. These savages
display much prudence in the choice of the si-
tuation of their hordes. They generally choose
a place which has a wood close behind, a
lake, river, or marsh in front, and pasture for
their horses on‘ both sides. Barreda told me
that whenever hordes so situated were to be at—
tacked‚ he ordered his men to besiege them on
the part towards the wood, that the savages
might not, as usual, find their security there;
but that the soldiers never obeyed his orders,
well knowing that if they deprived the enemy
of an opportunity of escape they should have a
most dangerous conflict, and a very doubtful
victory.
