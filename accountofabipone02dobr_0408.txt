396 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

Governour, in every expedition, in the capacity
of life-guards. Many of these are merely
honorary, never having discharged the duties
of captains, or even of soldiers. They purchase
the title, that they may be exempted from the
burden of war, being only called out to attend
the Vice-Governour. All the rest are summon-
ed to warlike expeditions either by the Gover-
nour, or Vice-Governour. They receive neither
pay nor clothing from the King, and are obliged
to furnish their own arms, horses, and food,
whenever, and as long as the military com-
mander thinks fit.

Every age and every country has found the
soldiers of Spain abundantly brave and active.
To deny this would be to wrong that most
noble and glorious nation. That the Spanish
name, therefore, may receive no blemish from
what I am going to write of the Paraguayrian
soldiers, it must be observed that all those who
boast of a Spanish name in Paraguay, are not
in reality Spaniards. Amid such a diversity of
nations, very many are born of Moors, In-
dians, and a Spanish mother; of an Indian or
Moorish mother, and a Spanish father; or of a

mixed race of them all. A yellow or darkish ’

complexion, a beardlcss chin, and a mat of
woolly, curling black hair, plainly denote very
many to be of African or American origin.
