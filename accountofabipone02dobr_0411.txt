HISTORY OF THE AmPONES. 399

times even, whenever some hundreds of sol-
diers fieroely approached the stations of the
savages, either the steel was rusty and would
not explode, or the gunpowder so moist as to
prevent its blazing, so that very few were able
to discharge their guns. I could fill pages
with facts of this kind, but will only relate two
of the more recent oneS. A handful of Abi·
pones were overrunning the territory of St.
Iago. Thirty soldiers were sent to observe
their motions, but being suddenly attacked by
the savages, who had lain in wait for them,
were every one miserably slain. They had
passed the night in the open air, and as the
guns were very badly taken care of, the copious
dew so moistened the gunpowder, that Vesuvius
itself would not have been able to kindle it. This
slaughter was effected by twenty Abiponian
youths. Two hundred soldierS, headed by
Fulgentio de Yegros, attacked the hordes of
the Tobas. Ι was astonished to hear the cap-
tains‚ on their return from this expedition,
lamenting that at the very moment of the
savages' assault, they had found their muskets
unmanageable, and quite useless, either from
rust or wet. They had spent greatest part of
the night in a field, amongst trees dropping
with plenteous dew, that at day-break they
might steal unobserved to the enemy's station.
