400 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

to no one, that the undisciplined, and temporary
soldiers of Paraguay, are accustomed neither
to the keeping, nor handling of weapons. They
have been employed all their lives in different
arts and occupations. Unless a man be pre-
viously instructed in military discipline, who
can expect him to prove a proper soldier in the
camp? Many go out against the savages who
are soldiers and Spaniards in name only. If
any of the colonistS‚ more respectable by birth
and fortune, and better furnished with arms
and skill to use them, are summoned to attend
an expedition, they usually hire very bad sub-
titutes. Others, that they may not be sepa*
rated from their families, and exposed to the
weapons of the enemy, bribe the captains to
pass them over3 in consequence of which, those
who are worst provided with armS‚ and most
ignorant of the military art, principally feel
the burden of the war, and are sent to oppose
the savageS, to the great detriment of the pro-
vince, and disgrace of the Spanish name. Be-
cause the lower orders are poor, they are
ordered to fight, while the more opulent are
left at home to take care of their estates: and
as they are forced out to the service again
and again, and obliged to spend many months
from home, they grow daily poorer and poorer,
and, together with their saniilies, are over-
whelmed with misery.
