HISTORY oF THE ABIPONES. 415-

fortune, that, abandoning their project of
plundering the colony, they sought security
in the adjacent woods. But being prevented
from this by the AbiponeS, they rushed off on
all sides. The enemies hurried away at full
gallop3 the Abipones endeavoured to overtake

them. It was not a fight, but a race between
‚Åπ the fugitives and their pursuerS. The contest
consisted more in the, swiftness of their steeds
than in weapons, which were sent backwards
and sorwards, but, because badly aimed, with-
out injuring very many. Our victors returned
to the colony when the night was far advanced,
some not till the morning, all safe and sound,
(except one, whose head was bruised with a
club,) and, what was very surprizing, quite so-
ber, having exhaled the effects of the liquor,
not with sleeping, but with riding and fighting.
How many of the enemies were killed and
wounded I do not know: but that more than two
hundred were put to ssight by seventy drunken
men was a noble victory for us. Let us now
treat of the other preparations which the Abi-
pones make previous to a fight.

Every thing being in readiness for the drink-
ing-party, which is held before a battle, their
chief anxiety is to conceal their droves of
horses from the eyes and hands of the enemy.
