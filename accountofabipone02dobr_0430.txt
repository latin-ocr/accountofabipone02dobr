418 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONEs.

jugglers are observed crawling on the ground, or
leaping in the streetS‚ and with sullen eyes and
a hoarse voice, uttering some omen or curse.
You may see the Abipones with their faces
stained, with many-coloured feathers in their
heads, and arms in their han'dS‚ some wearing
breastplates, others entirely naked, enter the
field with a marching gait, and appearing to
threaten the whole world. You may see
mountains in labour bring forth ridiculous mice.
These heroes, when placed in order of battle,
wish to be counted by the Father‚ as they can-
not count themselves. As I walked up ancl down
the ranks, 1 was frequently asked, “ Are we
many ?'' to which I constantly replied, “ You
are very many;” lest they should be disheart-
ened at their want of numbers. Experience
taught me that the towns were mostly attacked
by a numerous enemy when very few of
the inhabitants were left at home—the rest
being dispersed far and wide for the sake of
hunting. The sagacioris savages make the
assault when they have learnt srom their spies
that the colony is bare of defenders. They
form themselves into a square, if the place will
admit of it. Ι observed that they sometimes
placed the archers in the midst, and the spear-
men on each wing3 at otherS, the archers and
spearmen ranged themselves promiscuously.
