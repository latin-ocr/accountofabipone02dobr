It will soon ferment, they cry as they go away.
Till at length some one comes, who, judging by
his nose, declares that it has gained the neces-

flock to the appointed place. Those leathern
vessels, full of foaming rnead, are each brought
by the hands of six or eight girls, who lay
down their burden, and return home without
speaking a word to the drinkers. Before the first
vessel is quite exhausted, another is brought,
to that is added a third, then a fourth, and so
on. I did not in the least wonder to see the
women so alert and industrious in performing
these useful offices, because the more diligent
they are, the higher character they obtain
amongst their countrymen‚ and the greater
favour do they gain from their husbandS. It
must be confessed, however, that the Abipones‚
when they sup and dine in private, drink

nothing but water. l leave known Abipones
