HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 439

these drinking-partieS‚ as well as the married
men.

You will sooner eradicate from the minds of
the Americans any vice belonging to them, than
this wicked and pernicious intemperanee in
drinking. You will sooner persuade them to
live content with one wife, to abstain from
slaughter and rapine, to scorn their ancient su-
perstitionS‚ or to employ themselves in agricul-
ture and building houseS, notwithstanding their ²²
aversion to labour. To abolish the custom of
drinking-parties is indeed a most arduous work,
a labour of many yearS, and a business to per-
fect which no eloquence or industry of those
whose care and wish it was to convert the sa-
vage nations to Christianity‚ and conform them
to the divine laws, was ever equal. At length,
however, we have had the satisfaction of be-
holding this wicked custom of drinking yield to
our unwearied toils, and almost all the savages

submit to the law of God.
